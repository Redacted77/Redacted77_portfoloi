About Me 

I am a computer science student with a Python background. I am still learning, but I adapt quickly and have made a lot of progress in a short time. I enjoy automating repetitive tasks and building clean, functional tools. 
 Though I often work solo, I believe that with enough time and focus, I can deliver any task in a well-structured way. I'm interested in a variety of work to expand my experience and improve my skills. 

 

Skills & Tools 

Languages & Skills 

Python 

Problem-solving 

Adaptability 

Tools & Libraries 

OpenCV 

PySide6 

 

Projects 

Video Player 

A simple Video player like VLC 

Tools: Pyside6, Python-VLC 
 Role: Full development 

 GitHub: Redacted77/Video_Player: A video player that uses PySide6 for the GUI and python-vlc for video playback. 

Automation Script 

I created a small Python script to automate sorting files in Download folder, renaming, and it can also monitor the folder for future changes, or it can sort it once . 
 Tools: Python Standard Library 
 Role: Developer 
 GitHub: Redacted77/Folder_Sort: Folder Sort is a program that sorts files into designated folders. It can also keep monitoring the folder for changes and logs all events. 

Folder Encryption System (In Progress) 

A Python-based application that combines facial recognition with a user-defined PIN to create a secure, two-factor authentication system for encrypting and decrypting folders on a local machine. 

Core Features 

Two-Factor Biometric Security: Combines facial recognition (via face_recognition and OpenCV) with PIN authentication for enhanced protection. 

Folder Encryption: Uses cryptography.fernet to securely encrypt and decrypt folders and subdirectories, ensuring data confidentiality. 

User Access Management: Stores user profiles (name, PIN, access level, and face encodings) in a SQLite database. 

Admin Privileges: Admin users can add/remove users and adjust access levels securely through a restricted menu. 

Logging & Auditing: All folder operations and authentication attempts are logged for traceability and auditing. 

Safe File Handling: Encrypts/decrypts in a temporary directory before replacing originals to prevent data loss. 

Quarantine System: Isolates any files that fail during processing, maintaining overall operation integrity. 

Highlights 

Modular OOP Architecture: Clean separation of logic across components: 

LockSystem for encryption and file operations 

FacialRecognitionSystem for capturing and validating biometric data 

DatabaseManager for handling SQLite operations 

Advanced Error Handling: Custom exceptions and quarantine mechanism ensure reliability. 

Dependency Injection: Core systems are decoupled for testability and maintainability. 

Security Safeguards: Prevents accidental encryption of system or project directories. 

Tools Used 

Language: Python 

Libraries: face_recognition, dlib, OpenCV, cryptography.fernet, sqlite3, NumPy, pickle 

Modules: os, shutil, pathlib 

Status: Currently finalizing admin access control, Ui elements and logging system.
