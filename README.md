## About Me

I am a computer science student with a Python background. I am still learning, but I adapt quickly and have made a lot of progress in a short time. I enjoy automating repetitive tasks and building clean, functional tools. Though I often work solo, I believe that with enough time and focus, I can deliver any task in a well-structured way. I'm interested in a variety of work to expand my experience and improve my skills.

## Projects

### üîπ Video Player  
A simple video player similar to VLC.  

**Tools:** PySide6, python-vlc  
**Role:** Full development  
**GitHub:** [Redacted77/Video_Player](https://github.com/Redacted77/Video_Player)  
> A video player that uses PySide6 for the GUI and python-vlc for video playback.

### üîπ Automation Script  
A small Python script to automate sorting files in a folder. It supports renaming and can monitor the folder for future changes or sort it once.

**Tools:** Python Standard Library  
**Role:** Developer  
**GitHub:** [Redacted77/Folder_Sort](https://github.com/Redacted77/Folder_Sort)  
> Folder Sort is a program that sorts files into designated folders. It can also keep monitoring the folder for changes and logs all events.

### üîπ Folder Encryption System *(In Progress)*  
A Python-based application that combines facial recognition with a user-defined PIN to create a secure, two-factor authentication system for encrypting and decrypting folders on a local machine.

#### Core Features
- **Two-Factor Biometric Security:** Combines facial recognition (via `face_recognition` and OpenCV) with PIN authentication.
- **Folder Encryption:** Uses `cryptography.fernet` to securely encrypt and decrypt folders and subdirectories.
- **User Access Management:** Stores user profiles (name, PIN, access level, and face encodings) in a SQLite database.
- **Admin Privileges:** Admin users can add/remove users and adjust access levels securely through a restricted menu.
- **Logging & Auditing:** Logs all folder operations and authentication attempts.
- **Safe File Handling:** Encrypts/decrypts in a temporary directory before replacing originals.
- **Quarantine System:** Isolates files that fail during processing to maintain integrity.

#### Highlights
- **Modular OOP Architecture:**
  - `LockSystem` for encryption and file operations  
  - `FacialRecognitionSystem` for biometric operations  
  - `DatabaseManager` for handling SQLite tasks  
- **Advanced Error Handling:** Custom exceptions and a quarantine mechanism ensure reliability.  
- **Dependency Injection:** Decoupled components for better testability and maintainability.  
- **Security Safeguards:** Prevents accidental encryption of system/project folders.

#### Tools Used
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** `face_recognition`, `dlib`, `OpenCV`, `cryptography.fernet`, `sqlite3`, `NumPy`, `pickle`  
- **Modules:** `os`, `shutil`, `pathlib`  
- **Status:** Finalizing admin access control, UI elements, and logging system.
